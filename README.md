> Weâ€™ll make our own version of the classic command line tool grep (globally search a regular expression and print). 
<br/>
In the simplest use case, grep searches a specified file for a specified string. 
<br/>
To do so, grep takes as its arguments a filename and a string. Then it reads the file, finds lines in that file that contain the string argument, and prints those lines.
